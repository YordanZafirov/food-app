# Food App

Welcome to the Food App project! This application helps users discover and share recipes, plan meals, and manage grocery lists.

This is a **NextJS** app that I have created to test the possibilities of server-side and client-side rendering.

## Features

- **Recipe Discovery**: Browse and search for recipes from various cuisines.
- **Share a Recipe**: You can write your own recipies and save them to the website.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/food-app.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd food-app
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
2. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.
